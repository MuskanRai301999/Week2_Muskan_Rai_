Yes, it's possible to create a function in PostgreSQL using Sequalize.
Sequelize is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js, which provides an easier way to interact with databases,
including creating tables, defining models, and performing CRUD operations.

Steps to use Sequelize:-

1.Installing Sequelize using 'npm install sequalize'.
2.Create a sequelize file sequelize.ts and import it to initialize Sequelize and define your database connection.
3.Create a file named Model.ts to define a Sequelize model for the table.
4.We can use authenticate() functio to check whether the database is connected or not.
5.You can use Sequelize's sync() method to automatically create tables if they do not exist. 
6.Insert entities into the table:After ensuring that the table exists, we can proceed to insert entities into the table using
 Sequelize's model methods like create().
